# README for rjyang.me landing page - April 5th, 2019


## 1) URL of the original landing page I was mimicking: 

#### https://simpleanalytics.io


## 2) What I did and didn't do
#### What I did: I got the general color scheme and layout (especially nav elements) down. I also was able to get the hamburger menu to work for smaller screens. I used some css styling that included hover and checkbox-tricks, and tried to make things look presentable. I believe that my landing page scales well into smaller screens, based on tests that I ran by resizing my browser and opening the page on my phone. I also got some cool css transitions to work, especially card flipping effects.

#### What didn't work: I couldn't get the hamburger menu to change icons when clicked. I also couldn't get the typing animation from the simpleanalytics.io site to work.

## 3) Screen caps of my layout stage (some elements changed as I styled my site, with some content changing to be more comprehensive or fitting)
